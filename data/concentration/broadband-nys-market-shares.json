  "notes": "The broadband market in NYS is highly concentrated (HHI > 2,500). Most households have a practical choice between one cable provider and Verizon FiOS (where available). T-Mobile's fixed wireless service has introduced some competition since 2021. Governor Hochul's $1B ConnectALL program aims to expand publicly-owned broadband infrastructure, particularly in underserved upstate regions."
