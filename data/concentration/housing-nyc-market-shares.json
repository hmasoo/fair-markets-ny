  "notes": "Citywide HHI is low because the market is fragmented across ~30,000 landlords. However, at the neighborhood level, concentration is dramatically higher — e.g., Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper Village (Blackstone) represents near-monopoly ownership in that micro-market. Institutional/PE ownership has grown from ~2% to ~8% of total units since 2015."
